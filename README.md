# Virtual Try-On Eyewear In React Using Tensorflow andÂ Three.js

This project combines the power of React, TensorFlow.js, and Three.js to create an interactive and fun virtual try-on experience for eyewear. 


## Project Overview

This application leverages TensorFlow for facial landmark detection within a video stream, React for building the user interface, and Three.js for placing and adjusting virtual sunglasses in real-time. The result is a seamless virtual try-on experience that mimics trying on glasses in person.
